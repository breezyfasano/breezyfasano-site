I began coding when I was 10 years old. It was 2004; the internet was stumbling out of it's clumsy infant years, and so was I. Like [many other women who code](https://variety.com/2017/gaming/features/neopets-internet-girl-culture-1202897761/), my humble beginnings began on Neopets.com. I was given control over my pet's "pet page", and I was able to put whatever I wanted up with some HTML. I could even make the background as bright hot pink as I wanted with CSS. Immediately, I began reading up on anything I could about basic web coding [(Thanks Lissa!)](http://www.lissaexplains.com/) and started making graphics for myself and other Neopets users using MS Paint. When a family friend gave me a copy of Photoshop 5, my pet bios and user profile pages were plastered in gradients, flower pictures, and intense drop shadows. 

There, I learned the basics of iterating through design decisions. I'd make multiple versions of things, coding them up, and seeing which designs "felt" better and easier to use. I developed an eye for composition, spacing, and even basic color theory based on trial and error. My work was not only praised, but *genuinely appreciated* by other young girls who didn't know much about computers but still wanted to express themselves. Coding and graphic design gave me control over something: a means to create something that mattered. Back then, I didn't have any control over a difficult home life. This meant everything to me, and was quickly rooted in my identity. I don't know where I would be without the ~8 years I spent on that website.

I continued with design throughout high school, creating basic posters for my friends' bands and a t-shirt design or two for various school clubs. It was around my junior year of high school when I realized: *hey, I could probably make this my life's work and feel pretty happy about it.* When I graduated, I began to browse Craigslist, and got my first job at a local business as a Digital Marketing Consultant at 17. 

Throughout my life's ups and downs and even its sideways, my passion for this ever changing field only grew. I love learning, and even though it's difficult to keep up when the frameworks/languages/libraries/buzzwords, I enjoy every second. Even  when I'm screaming internally looking for that missing semi-colon. The goal is set: I will be a Front End Developer & Designer!

Over the past few years, at the opportunity of the wonderful open source community, I read books, ran through tutorials, watched videos, and hardly ever followed up with the knowledge I learned. Within the past 6 months or so, I started taking my goals and learning seriously. Giving back to the community while simultaneously applying my new knowledge is paramount to my growth as a developer. Thus, the blog is born.

I plan to document my learning process here. I want to make any charts, notes, and study tools to be published here for myself and others. I will review various learning resources, and post about projects I'm working on and why I do the things I do. I can't wait. Thank you for taking this journey with me.
