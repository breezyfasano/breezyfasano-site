Hi! I'm Breezy Fasano. I'm a Front End Developer and Designer trying to learn as much as possible in this ever-changing field. I live in the beautiful Chicagoland area, and am always looking to connect with other creatives. 

I utilize HTML, CSS, & JavaScript to build functional user interfaces. Currently, I'm seeking to expand my skills in intermediate JavaScript. I use Visual Studio Code combined with Gulp.js to run my build tasks, such as compiling Sass and minifying my code. 

When I'm not nose deep in my laptop, I'm shooting my film camera(s), playing PC games, reading, drinking fancy craft beers, and hanging out with my cat. üëç
